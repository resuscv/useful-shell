Some useful git commands that I just seem to keep FORGETTING...

--- PUSH ---

git push -u --follow-tags origin --all

    -u
        For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream
        (tracking) reference.

    --follow-tags
        Push annotated tags in refs/tags that are missing from the remote but
        are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs being
        pushed.

    --all
        Push all branches


--- ADD ---

git add -p <filename>

    -p
        Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree
        and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance to review the
        difference before adding modified contents to the index.
